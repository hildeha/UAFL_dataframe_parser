# Data Parser for Universal ascii lightning format âš¡
<br>
Python class that allows for a python requests response received in the universal ascii lightning format to be parsed to a pandas dataframe object.


Publicly available lightning data though MET Norway and Swedish SMHI are returned in the universal ascii lightning format. <br>The purpose of this Python project is to easily parse that data into a pandas dataframe (and numpy array).

A visualisation of the format can be found on MET Norway's Frost API resource pages:
